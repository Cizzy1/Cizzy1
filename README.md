1st year student at Wakefield University Centre currently learning Indie Games Development. I'm mainly a 3D artist 
but for programming, I mainly work on C# within Unity. I have worked with a range of languages from Python, 
Javascript but have mainly forgotten them. ðŸ˜¿

You will find most of my game repositories here from college and university.
